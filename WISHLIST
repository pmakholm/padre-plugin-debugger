Wishlist
========

This is a list of features missing in other modules. Not all of them is
reported as wishlist bugs for these modules. 

Padre
-----

 - API for adding entries to right click menu in editor (ticket #321).

   Would be nice to add 'Add breakpoint' and 'Continue to this line' entries
   to the right click menu. Fixed, but I'm not using it yet.


Devel::ebug
-----------

  - Flushable output command.

    It would be nice to only get output from the debugged process once. At the
    moment the ->output method returns the complete output of for the lifetime
    of the process. 

  - Configurable commandline for backend.

    I need some control of @INC in the backend process. I the moment I have no
    direct way of controling that. Fixed by subclassing Devel::ebug.
